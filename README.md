This project was created in the second term of my first year of college. 
The class was called "Object Oriented Programming" and had the purpose to teach us the basics of OOP using Python.

I worked with Jaime.

We were asked to create a rogue-like game using python. We could use external module like pygame or tkinter for the interface.
The graphical interface was not mandatory but added points to the mark.

The foundation of the project was made at school by following the teacher's indications. We could then add pretty much anything we wanted but had instructions on fonctionnality ideas that would bring more or less points to the mark.
